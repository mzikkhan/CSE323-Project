# CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulation

This project simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms using Python. The project provides implementations of the following scheduling algorithms:

- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Round Robin (RR)
- Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
- Priority Scheduling (PS)
- Priority Scheduling with Round Robin (PS-RR)
  
Each algorithm is visualized using a Gantt chart to demonstrate the scheduling process.

## Features
- GUI Interface: A graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter for interactive simulation of CPU scheduling algorithms.
- Dynamic Visualization: Real-time display of the scheduling process and Gantt charts using Matplotlib.
- Error Handling: Validates inputs to ensure proper simulation.

This project was developed for my university course CSE323: Operating Systems
